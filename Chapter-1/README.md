# Before we begin:

i would like to clarify that all the operations and everything explained here was done in the terminal by running "Python".


# Comments 1.1

So comments in python start with the hash character or better known as #. for example:

```
# This is a comment
>>> azanegay = 0 # This is also a comment
```

As you can see comments can be placed at the start of the line or even after the part of the code as visualised above.

But if the comment is inside of a quote it isnt a comment, just a regular text. An example:

```
>>> huza = "This is not a comment."
```

# Numbers 1.2

The interpreter acts like a simple calculator, you can type any calculation and it will run. You can use the operators `+`,`-`,`*` and `/`. They can used to perform calculations. and `()` can be used for grouping. For example:

```
>>> 2-2
0
>>> 50 + 3*3
59
>>> (15 - 5*2) / 5
1
>>> 8 / 5 # Divisions always return a floating point number.
1.6

```

The integer numbers (e.g. 2,9,10.) have type int. meanwhile fractional part (e.g. 1.69,5.420) have type float.

Divisions (`/`) always return a float. in the examle you can use `/` for varios things.

```
>>> 17 / 3 # Simple division that returns a float.
5.666666666666667

>>> 17 // 3 # floor division, this discards the fractional part.
5 

>>> 17 % 3 # the `%` operator returns the remainder of the division.
2 
>>> 5 * 6 + 2 # extra calculation.
32
```
