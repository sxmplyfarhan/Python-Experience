# Before we begin:

i would like to clarify that all the operations and everything explained here was done in the terminal by running "Python".


# Comments 1.1

So comments in python start with the hash character or better known as #. for example:

```#This is a comment. 
>>> azanegay = 0 #This is also a comment.``` 

As you can see comments can be placed at the start of the line or even after the part of the code as visualised above.

But if the comment is inside of a quote it isnt a comment, just a regular text. An example:

`>>> huza = "This is not a comment."`


# Numbers 1.2
